//I have created a table in MySql called Products that hold information about the product_name, department_name, price, and stock_quantity.

// I will populate the table with dummy information provided by myself

//1.The app will first ask the user what they would like to purchase 2. then ask them about the quantity of the item.

//the app will keep track of how many items it has "in stock". 

//if product is out of stock then app will notify the user.

//the app will reflect what is in the bamazon "stock".
